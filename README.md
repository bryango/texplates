# TeXplates
Tried-to-be-but-failed-to-be-minimalist modular templates for LaTeX

## Hooks
There is a pre-commit hook to generate `release/*`. To install that,
```bash
ln -s git-hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/
```

## Note
This repo used to be `bryango/Templates` and contains Mathematica templates; now they are maintained in a separate repo: `bryango/Physica`
